Virtual Pet Game

Think DigiPet. Think Tamagotchi. 
Welcome to Virtual Pet, desgined by Satnam Brar. This console application will allow you to take care of your own virtual pet. 
Be careful, however. Your virtual pet needs you to take care of it. Soon you will love your Virtual Pet as much as it loves you!

You will be greeted by your new virtual pet at the beginning of the game. The virtual pet will need to be fed, taken out for potty, 
and given time for play. Through user input in the console application, you will be able to complete tasks to ensure your virtual pet
stays happy and healthy. Enjoy!
